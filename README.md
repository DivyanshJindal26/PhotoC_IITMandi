Built this with the idea of giving our campus memories a proper home — one place to view, upload, and share the vibe 💙🏔️

🧠 Highlights:
- 🔐 Login restricted to IIT Mandi students only (via Firebase)
- 🌍 Public gallery — anyone can browse the photos
- ⬆️ Students can upload pics, but nothing goes live without a ✅ — uploads go through an admin approval system
- 📲 Fully mobile responsive — looks great on phones, tablets, laptops, you name it
- 🔍 Built-in search & filters to find photos by event name or uploader
- ❤️ Users can like images, and the gallery auto-sorts by popularity to highlight the best moments 🔥

💡 Future Plans:
- 🏛️ Get it officially hosted under IIT Mandi's domain so it's certified and permanent
- 📅 Auto-event albums after major fests
- 💬 Comments + interaction features
